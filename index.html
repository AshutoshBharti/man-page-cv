<h1>STORY SO FAR (if you don't want to read complete resume just read this)</h1>
<p class="subtext">
Started career as a Network engineer (ECE graduate) at Orange Business Services, worked on monitoring its backbone and troubleshooting related issues. It is here, where I developed the understanding of networks, ip, subnets and NMS softwares.</p>

<p class="subtext">
Joined Helpshift, as a Systems Engineer, started with running basic linux commands, creating users, cleaning disk spaces. Moved onto automating sysadmin tasks and then Devops. I learnt, tried, broke, worked and reworked tasks involving the below mentioned tech stacks. <a href="#option4">[SKILLS]</a>. By the time I left, I was owner of monitoring (sensu + graphite), CICD, Kafka(on ec2) and Postgres(on ec2) at Helpshift.
</p>

<p class="subtext">
Moved to Hungerbox as an SRE Lead managing a small team of 2 people (including me). I was hired to facilitate the movement of infra from one account to another and prepare for the daily order scale up from 40K to 4L. Wrote tons of terraform, boto3 and ansible to port the infra to IaC</a>.
</p>

<p class="subtext">
My role as Senior SRE with Fireeye Inc, started when Fireeye was setting their SRE team in Bangalore for their product <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/products/helix.html">'Helix'</a>. Toiled hundreds of hours in efforts to move services from EC2 to EKS. Moved monitoring from Graphite to Prometheus + VictoriaMetrics. Most notable work would be writing a REST API service (backed by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/">Document DB</a>) which helps devs, operations and almost everyone at Fireeye to GET relevant information about services. SRE can PUT, POST or DELETE the information about the services.
</p>

<p class="subtext">
My current role as a Staff SRE (and lead) at Ocrolus Inc, Gurugram, is a story that unfloded mainly because of my love for data-science, data-analytics and streaming services (Kafka, Debezium, spark, Tableau, snowflake). Things that I have done great at so far are, implementing debezium for bringing data from AWS RDS to AWS MSK, bring down full data-sync (3TB) time from RDS to MSK to 6h (from 14h), moving development teams to use <a href="https://garden.io/">'garden'</a> for them to have the same code deployed and tested remotely without the hassle of maintaining local docker and k8s. Introducing access restrictions that prevents US data being visible to non-US employees and vice-versa.
</p>

<p class="subtext">
  Highlights:
</p>
<ul class="subtext">
  <li> <b>AWS</b>: infra that sees a scale of millions of events per second, used by Banks;</li>
  <li> <b>Azure</b>: replicating AWS infra in azure from the ground up;</li>
  <li> <b>K8s</b>: porting services from ec2 to k8s using EKS, ECS, helm;</li>
  <li> <b>IaC</b>: moving the infra to from no code (all manual) to infrastructure;</li>
  <li> <b>Scale</b>: handling traffic growing from 11K rps to 200K rps;</li>
  <li> <b>Monitoring</b>: centralised monitoring for infra of 5 accounts and 2 cloud providers;</li>
  <li> <b>Automations</b>: custom monitoring scripts, tools for auto alert's remediations;</li>
  <li> <b>CI/CD</b>: designing, writing, deploying complete CI/CD infra, spans across AWS, Azure;</li>
  <li> <b>Upgrades</b>: carrying out upgrades (no downtime): PG, Mongo, MySQL, Kafka, Zookeeper;</li>
  <li> <b>Enabler</b>: reducing dependency of developers on devops/sre (25 to 4 weekly tickets);</li>
  <li> <b>Bookkeeper</b>: established a culture of documentation, processes, audits and RCAs;</li>
  <li> <b>Cautious</b>: taking care of security audit needs for the company;</li>
  <li> <b>Moneyminded</b>: moving to serverless as/where possible, optimizations to contain costs</li>
</ul>
